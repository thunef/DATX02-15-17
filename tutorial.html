<h3 id="prog">Creating a program</h3>
<p> The different tabs represent different types of blocks which can be seen when you click on the tabs.</p> 
<img src="tutorials/tabs.PNG" alt="tabs" style="width:304px;">
<p>If you click on <i>Motion</i> for example, you will see blocks that can make the robot move, 
such as forward, backward and turn.<br>
To create a program, you simply click on a block and drag it to the workspace, where you then drop it. </p>
<img src="tutorials/dragndrop.PNG" alt="dragndrop" style="width:304px;">
<p>Usually you will begin with a <i>When clicked</i> block. This will mark the beginning of your program and tell the PedaGogo 
when to start executing your program, which means it will start to do the things your program tells it to when you click on the
button with the same colour. 
There are three buttons to chose from; green, blue and yellow.</p>
<img src="tutorials/buttons.PNG" alt="buttons" style="width:150px;">
<p>You may have seen that there is also a red button on the PedaGogo, this button will be explained later on.<br>
You can tell by the shapes of the blocks how they fit together. By dragging the blocks inside or underneath other
blocks, they will snap into place automatically.</p>
<img src="tutorials/fit.PNG" alt="fit" style="width:304px;">
<p><a href="#menu">Back to Menu</a></p>

<h3 id="loops">Loops</h3>
<img src="tutorials/loops.PNG" alt="loops" style="width:304px;">
<p>The orange blocks that you see above are called loops. You can use these to repeat parts of, or all of, your 
program. If you want to, for example, spin round four times, you can put the repeat block around the turn 
block and change the repeat-value to 4.</p>
<img src="tutorials/loops2.PNG" alt="loops2" style="width:230px;">
<p>To change the values in the blocks, double click on them and type in a new value!</p>
<img src="tutorials/siffror.PNG" alt="siff" style="width:210px;">
<p id="dmnds">The <i>forever block</i> will repeat (loop) the blocks placed inside forever, or until you end the program.
The <i>repeat until block</i> has an empty space shaped like a diamond. You can find the blocks that fit in here under the
tab called Operators. </p>
<img src="tutorials/diamonds.PNG" alt="dmnds" style="width:150px; ">
<p>To use these, you need to know more about variables.</p>
<p><a href="#menu">Back to Menu</a></p>

<h3 id="var">Variables</h3>
<p>Variables are used to store information, for example they can be used as counters. This can be used in loops: 
instead of changing the value in a <i>repeat block</i>, you could use a <i>repeat until block</i> like in the picture
below.</p>
<img src="tutorials/var.PNG" alt="var" style="width:250px; ">
<p> There are no variables when you begin your program, you need to make them. To do this, click on the <i>Data</i>
tab and then on the <i>Make a Variable</i> button.</p>
<img src="tutorials/makevariable.PNG" alt="makevar" style="width:250px; ">
<p>You will then be asked to give your variable a name. Try to think of good names for your variables so that you remember
what they are for. For example <i>NbrOfSpins</i> or <i>TimesLeft</i>. Once you have created your variable, you will get some
new blocks to use.</p>
<img src="tutorials/newvar.PNG" alt="newvar" style="width:250px; ">
<p> With the <i>set block</i> you decide the starting value of your variable. If you want to count upwards for example,
you can start on 0, if you're counting down, then set your variable to the highest value you want to use. With the
<i>change-by block</i> you decide by how much you want your variable to change each time. For instance if you are counting
then you should set this value to 1. </p>
<p>Variables are also used for conditionals which are explained below.</p>
<p><a href="#menu">Back to Menu</a></p>

<h3 id="con">Conditionals</h3>
<p>A condition is when you say <i>If this happens, do that</i>. So for example, you can use variables to say <i>if speed
reaches max speed, then decrease the speed</i>. This is done using orange blocks in the <i>Control</i> tab that begin with 
<i>if</i>. An example is shown below.</p>
<img src="tutorials/cond.PNG" alt="cond" style="width:250px; ">
<p>This means that if the value of the variable, which in this case may be a speed, is bigger than 10, then decrease 
speed by 2.</p>
<p>There is also an <i>if-then-else block</i> which means that if the variable, in the example above, is not bigger than
10, then you can tell it to do something else. Below, it is now telling the robot to increase the speed by two if the variable is
less than 10.</p>
<img src="tutorials/cond2.PNG" alt="cond2" style="width:250px; ">
<p><a href="#menu">Back to Menu</a></p>

<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
<p>Lists are used to keep variables or values in a specific order. You can add and delete things from a list but also
replace items in the list with other values or variables. You can also check whether a list contains a certain value or
not.</p>
<img src="tutorials/newlist.PNG" alt="lists" style="width:304px; ">
<p>As with variables, there are no ready lists to use, you need to make your own. In the tab called <i>Data</i>, click
on the <i>Make a List</i> button and choose a name for your list.</p>
<img src="tutorials/makelist.PNG" alt="lists2" style="width:250px; ">
<p>You can then start adding values or variables to your list using the <i>add block</i>, which adds your values
 last in your list. You can also use the <i>insert-at-of block</i> by saying where in the list you want to
 add your value.</p>
 <p>You can see an example of how to use a list below.</p>
<img src="tutorials/usinglist.PNG" alt="lists3" style="width:250px; ">
<p>This program will add the values 50, 40 and 10 to the list called List in that order. It will then increase the speed
by the first value in the list, and then delete this value so that in the next loop, the first value in the list is now
40. It will do this 3 times so that the last increase in speed will be by 10, then the list will be empty.</p>
<p><a href="#menu">Back to Menu</a></p>

<h3 id="Op">Operators</h3>
<p>Operators are the green blocks that can be found under the <i>Operators</i> tab. They can be used with values that
you write yourself or with variables.</p>
<img src="tutorials/ops.PNG" alt="ops" style="width:250px; ">
<p>In the picture below you can see some examples of how to use operators.</p>
<img src="tutorials/opsex.PNG" alt="ops2" style="width:304px; ">
<p>In the first <i>If</i> block there is an <i>equals</i> operator saying that the value of the variable should equal
10. In the <i>repeat until</i> block there is an <i>or</i> operator. This is saying that the value of the variable should
either be larger than 10, or, the value of the variable plus 5 should equal 14. The loop will repeat until one of these
is true.<br>
In the next <i>if</i> block you can see an <i>and</i> operator. This is saying that the value of the variable should be
larger than 1, and, the value should be smaller than 5. So, the value of the variable has to be between 1 and 5 for this
to be true.</p>
<p>The <i>mod</i> operator is a bit tricky to understand. This is used to say that a number can be divided by another number and the
result will be a whole number, meaning there will be no decimals. So for instance, 9 divided by 3 is 3, and 10 divided by 2 is 5.
If the result is a whole number, the result of using <i>mod</i> will be 0. This can be used to, for example, 
check if a number is even or odd like in the example below. </p>
<img src="tutorials/oddeven.PNG" alt="ops3" style="width:304px; ">
<p><a href="#menu">Back to Menu</a></p>

<h3 id="prog1">Uploading your program to PedaGogo</h3>
<p>You will need a USB memory-stick. When you are satisfied with your program and wish to test it on the PedaGogo,
simply press <i>File</i> and then <i>Save Project</i>, saving your project to the USB memory-stick.</p> 
<img src="tutorials/upload.PNG" alt="up" style="width:304px; ">
<p>Then all you need to do is put the memory-stick into the PedaGogo and press the red button on the robot. 
The red button is the restart button and it uploads the program saved to your memory-stick onto the robot. 
Then, when you click on the button you have chosen to start your program, the PedaGogo will start to follow the 
commands you have given it!</p>
<p>You can also load a project from the memory-stick, so you can pick up where you left off last time without having
to redo your program!</p>
<p><a href="#menu">Back to Menu</a></p>

<h2 id="mot">Motion</h2>
<p>Practise makes perfect! Read about Direction and Speed to complete the following tasks.</p>
<p><a href="#t1">Task 1</a>
   <a href="#t2">Task 2</a>
   <a href="#t3">Task 3</a></p>
<p><a href="#t4">Task 4</a>
   <a href="#t5">Task 5</a>
   <a href="#t6">Task 6</a></p>

<h3 id="dir">Direction and Speed</h3>
<p>The speed can be changed by changing the values in the speed blocks. Changing the value by 1 means.. Blablabla. 
Max speed is.. Min speed is.. jadajadajada!</p>
<img src="tutorials/speed.PNG" alt="speed" style="width:210px; ">
<p>To tell the robot to make a turn, you use the turn blocks to turn either left or right. You can decide how many degrees
 the robot should turn by changing the value in the blocks. Here are some values of degrees you could use.</p>
 <img src="tutorials/andragrader.PNG" alt="fit" style="width:180px; ">
 <p>Below are some examples of how the robot turns depending on the degree-value</p>
 <img src="tutorials/grader.PNG" alt="grader" style="width:304px; ">
 <p id="grader2">If you need the robot to turn around at a specific angle, like when you want it to move in a triangle, 
 remember to calculate the correct angle for the turn-block as follows:</p>
  <img src="tutorials/grader2.PNG" alt="grader2" style="width:304px; ">
  <p><a href="#menu">Back to Menu</a></p>
<p>You can practise your skillzzz by completing the following tasks! Enjoooy!</p>

<h3 id="t1">Task 1: Speed</h3>
<p><b>1.</b> Try changing the speeds from the minimum speed to the maximum by using the <a href="#dir">increase speed</a> 
block, try some different values in the increase block to see the difference.</p>
<img src="tutorials/task1speed.PNG" alt="task1" style="width:304px; ">
<p><b>2.</b> This time, try using a <a href="#loops">loop</a> to gradually increase the speed up to the maximum speed, 
then use another loop to decrease the speed down to the minimum speed.</p>
<p><i><b>Remember:</b> the max speed is 255 (?) and the minimum speed is ??.</i></p>
<p><a href="#mot">Back to Motion</a></p>

<h3 id="t2">Task 2: Shapes</h3>
<p><b>1.</b>Use the turn-blocks to make the robot drive in a square shape and then try a circle. 
Try to use <a href="#loops">loops</a> to do this.<br>
<i><b>Hint:</b> A circle is like a square, but with many more corners.</i></p>
<img src="tutorials/task2.PNG" alt="task2" style="width:304px; ">
<p><b>2.</b>This time try to use the turn-blocks to make the robot drive in a triangle. The angles should all be the same size. 
Then try again with different sizes for the angles.</p>
<p><i><b>Remember:</b> how to <a href="#grader2">calculate the angles.</a></i></p>  
<p><a href="#mot">Back to Motion</a></p>

<h3 id="t3">Task 3: ZigZag</h3>
<p><b>1.</b>Use what you have learned about angles to write a program that will tell the robot to drive forward in 
a zigzag motion. Don't forget to use a loop if you can!</p>
<img src="tutorials/zigzag.PNG" alt="task3" style="width:304px; ">
<p><b>2.</b> This time try to make the robot move forward in a more slithery motion, like a snake.</p>'
<img src="tutorials/mjukzig.PNG" alt="task3b" style="width:304px; ">
<p><i><b>Hint:</b> you can use semi-circles to make the turns smoother.</i></p>
<p><a href="#mot">Back to Motion</a></p>

<h3 id="t4">Task 4: Variables</h3>
<p><b>1.</b>For this task you need to <a href="#var">make a variable.</a> Call it <i>Speed</i> and set it to 200.
As in task 2.1, use a loop to increase the speed of the robot but this time it should be from minimum speed to 200, the
value of your new variable. Use your <i>Speed</i> variable to do this.</p>
<p><i><b>Remember:</b> variables can be placed in the <a href="#dmnds">diamond shaped blocks</a> which fit nicely in some 
of the loops.</i></p>
<p><b>2.</b>This time, make a variable called <i>SpinTimes</i> and set it to five. Write a program that will make your robot
spin around five times using your variable.</p>
<img src="tutorials/task4.PNG" alt="task4" style="width:200px; ">
<p><i><b>Hint:</b> the variable can be changed by -1.</i></p> 
<p><a href="#mot">Back to Motion</a></p>

<h3 id="t5">Task 5: Lists</h3>
<p><b>1.</b> In this task you need to <a href="#lists">create a list</a>. Call it <i>Speeds</i> and add five values
 (speeds) to your list. Now write a program that increases or decreases the speed by the amounts that you put in your 
 list.</p>
  <img src="tutorials/task5.PNG" alt="task5" style="width:304px; ">
 <i><b>Hint:</b> use a loop, and the blocks you get with your new list.</i>
 <p><b>2.</b> This time make a list and add values that you can use in a program instructing the robot to drive in the
 shape of a square. Don't forget to use a loop!</p>
 <i><b>Hint:</b> you only need to add two values; how many cm to go forward and how many degrees to turn. 
 By clicking on the arrow you can choose the first or last item from a list to use. </i>
 <img src="tutorials/task5b.PNG" alt="task5b" style="width:250px; ">

<p>Practise makes perfect!</p>
<p><a href="#t11">Task 1</a>
   <a href="#t21">Task 2</a>
   <a href="#t31">Task 3</a></p>
<p><a href="#t41">Task 4</a>
   <a href="#t51">Task 5</a>
   <a href="#t61">Task 6</a></p>
<p>Snacka om lamporna, vad roligt saaaa roligt, man kan han med dom!! </p>
<p>You can practise your skillzzz by completing the following tasks! Enjoooy!</p>
<h3 id="t11">Task 1: Blink</h3>
<p><b>1.</b> Use the <i>turn on</i> and <i>turn off</i> blocks to blink with the lights five times. Use a loop!</p>
<i><b>Hint:</b> if the lights are blinking too fast, use a wait block inbetween!</i>
 <img src="tutorials/task121.PNG" alt="task121" style="width:250px; ">
<p><b>2.</b> This time use a loop to blink with one light at a time, five times each.</p>
<p><a href="#led">Back to Lights</a></p>

<h3 id="t21">Task 2: Variables</h3>
<p><b>1.</b> Use a <i>repeat</i> block and a variable. Call the variable timesToBlink and use it to make the lights
blink 10 times. </p>
<i><b>Remember:</b> how to <a href="#var">make a variable?</a></i>
<p><b>2.</b> This time use the same variable but use the <i>repeat until</i> block to blink with every other
light 10 times.</p>
<p><a href="#led">Back to Lights</a></p>

<h3 id="t31">Task 3: Shapes</h3>
<p><b>1.</b> <a href="#t2">In task 2</a> of the motion chapter, you had to write a program telling the robot to drive in a square. 
Do this again but this time blink with the lights before each turn. </p>
<p><b>2.</b> This time, rewrite the program telling your robot to move forward in <a href"#t3">zigzag</a> and add a few 
blinks of the lights before each turn. Only blink with one of the lights to show which direction your are turning.</p>
<img src="tutorials/zigzag.PNG" alt="task3" style="width:304px; ">
<p><a href="#led">Back to Lights</a></p>

<h3 id="t41">Task 4: Conditionals</h3>
<p><b>1.</b> Set timesToBlink to 0. Change your variable by 1 and check if your variable is bigger than 0 <i>and</i> 
less than 5, if it is blink with the left lights, if not, blink with the right lights. Do this ten times.</p>
<img src="tutorials/tasklight.PNG" alt="task4" style="width:304px; ">
<p><b>2.</b> This time, if your variable is an even number, blink with the left light, if it is odd, blink with the 
right light. Do this 10 times also.</p>
<i><b>Remember:</b> how to check if it is <a href="#ops">an even number?</a></i>     
<p><a href="#led">Back to Lights</a></p>

<h3 id="t51">Task 5: Lists</h3>
<p><b>1.</b> This task will be like task 4.2 but you will need to create a list. Set timesToBlink to 1 and loop the
following 10 times: add timesToBlink to the list, then increase its value by 1. Then with a second loop say that if
 the first element in the list is less than 5, blink with the right light, else blink with the left light. 
 Then remove the first element. Do this (second loop) until the list is empty.</p>
 <i><b>Remember:</b> how to <a href="#lists">make a list?</a></i><br>
<i><b>Hint:</b> when the list is empty the length of the list is 0.</i>
<p><b>2.</b> This time, using the second loop until the list is empty, you will instead check if the value of the
 first element in the list is an even number, blink with the right light, if it is odd, blink with the left light. </p>
